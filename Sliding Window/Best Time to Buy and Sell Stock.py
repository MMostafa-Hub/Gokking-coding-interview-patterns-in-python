Given an array where the element at the index i represents the price of a stock on day i,
find the maximum profit that you can gain by buying the stock once and then selling it.

constraints:
- We canâ€™t sell before buying a stock, that is, the array index at which stock is bought will always be less than the index at which the stock is sold.
- 1 <= array.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= array[i] <= 10^4

test case 1:
array = [10, 4, 11, 1, 5]
output: 7

test case 2:
array = [7, 7, 6, 6, 6]
output: 0

test case 3:
array = [4, 10, 5, 1, 6, 7]
output: 6
