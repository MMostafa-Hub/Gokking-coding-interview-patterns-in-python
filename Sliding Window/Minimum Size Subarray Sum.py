Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target,
find the window size of the shortest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target value.
If no subarray is found, 0 is returned.

constraints:
1 <= target <= 10^9
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

test case 1:
nums = [1, 2, 7, 1, 8]
target = 9
output: 2

test case 2:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 11
output: 3

test case 3:
nums = [7, 2, 4, 6, 5, 8]
target = 6
output: 1
